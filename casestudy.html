                <p>Some time ago, I had the idea to build a website that captures the feeling of walking into a petting zoo. That smell of hay. The soft sounds of chickens. The warm sense of a place where it‚Äôs okay to be curious ‚Äî where children can learn, feel, and experience life up close.</p>

                <p>That became <strong>Meadowbrook</strong>.</p>

                <p>It started with a simple HTML5 UP template. But I didn‚Äôt want to just fill in the blanks ‚Äî I wanted to create an experience. So I got to work: simplifying, personalizing, refreshing. The structure remained recognizable, but the soul of the site started to reflect me.</p>

                <h2>‚ú® What I Built</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A gentle introduction right on the homepage</li>
                    <li>Clear sections about animals, nature experiences, and creative workshops</li>
                    <li>Soft, inviting background images from Unsplash</li>
                    <li>A fully responsive layout that feels calm on mobile and desktop</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>üå± What I Learned</h2>
                <p>That simplicity can be powerful. You don‚Äôt always need a backend or a CMS. If your message is clear and the feeling is right ‚Äî it reaches people.</p>

                <p>I learned how small changes in typography, layout, and color can shape the entire emotional tone of a page. I learned to ask myself, ‚ÄúWhat would the visitor feel here?‚Äù and to let that question guide my design choices.</p>

                <h2>ü§ç Why This Project Matters To Me</h2>
                <p>Because it‚Äôs more than code. It‚Äôs a feeling. It‚Äôs an exercise in empathy.</p>

                <p>I imagined the child visiting the site. Or the parent, wondering if this farm would be right for their kid. That image stayed with me. It helped me make decisions. It made the process more human.</p>
